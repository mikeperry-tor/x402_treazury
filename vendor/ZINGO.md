# Zingo connector injection

`zingolib/`, `zingo-netutils/` and `pepper-sync/` contain source from zingolib revision
`c6381534f802b1022041beda4b01c106ad132329` (v6.0.0). Upstream licenses are
included. `zingo-connector.patch` records the connector Rust source changes:

- `GrpcIndexer::from_channel` wraps an application-owned tonic channel.
- `LightClient::set_indexer` installs that indexer without creating a direct socket.

`pepper-sync-diagnostics.patch` records the additional sync diagnostic changes.
Returned shard-tree errors retain their pool and operation (scan merge, reorg
rollback, or pool-recovery rollback) in a typed error. Existing recovery
recommendations are preserved. No tree insertion, truncation, retention,
serialization, request, or retry policy changes. The application extracts fixed
labels and discards the underlying error before logs and saved status; no tree
positions or hashes are exposed. The synthetic `scan_merge_conflict_preserves_pool_context`
unit fixture exercises actual conflicting merges in all three shielded pools,
without wallet keys or network requests. Pepper Sync retains its upstream unit-test
dependencies for this fixture.

Every existing RPC, cloned indexer and pepper-sync stream uses the supplied channel.
The application constructs both direct and authenticated SOCKS channels through
`network.rs`; it creates LightClient offline and installs that indexer before sync
or proposal work. It does not use upstream online constructors, URI setters,
migration transmitters, price fetchers or optional nym workers.

Cargo manifests expand workspace-inherited dependencies, pin sibling Git crates to
the same revision and omit upstream standalone test/example/bench targets and dev
dependencies, except Pepper Sync’s unit-test dependencies. Library sources
(including testutils used by our consensus suite),
build scripts and licenses are preserved. The combined compatibility manifest uses
these same patches. Run `python3 vendor/verify_zingo.py` to check all
reviewed files against `zingo-sources.json`; compare `zingo-connector.patch` with the
pinned upstream commit when updating; check `pepper-sync-diagnostics.patch` too.
Never edit a reference checkout or Cargo's Git cache to implement these patches.

Sapling parameters are obtained and embedded by the upstream build script, not
fetched by runtime wallet operations. Generated `zcash-params/*.params` files are
ignored and excluded from snapshot verification. Build-time network acquisition is
outside runtime Tor routing. Pre-populate the standard Sapling parameter cache for
an offline first build.
